## Can I help with this project?
I'm working actively on the project but some times I make mistakes, so if you want to help me out, just shoot me a message or open up a pull request. I have a list of future updates at the bottom, so you can check that out and see what the future will offer. If you want to see specific updates you can also open an issue, and let me know :)

# Why did you create this?
I got really bored of looking at my current portfolio, cause it looked the same as everyone elses. So I thought what can I do to make it nicer/stand out. And this was pretty much what I decided to do. (Thinking about making a different design now so...)
